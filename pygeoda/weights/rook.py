    Args:
        geoda_obj (geoda): An instance of geoda class
        order (int, optional): order of contiguity
        include_lower_order (bool, optional):  whether or not the lower order neighbors should be

            to allow for an exact match of coordinates to determine 
            which polygons are neighbors
